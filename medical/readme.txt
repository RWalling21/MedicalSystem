Welcome to Simple Medical! (Created by Beb AKA Terry)
This script was created for servers looking for a medical system not intended for super serous servers (It will still work in a serous environment)
It's easy to setup, and will work well in a DarkRP, MilRP, SWRP, or even Sandbox environment

Setup
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All setup options can be edited in config.lua found under medical/lua/config
Here I will be answering some common questions about the script


What are the condition for?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fracture
The fracture is intended to prevent players from taking a "Leap of faith"
Instead of players blindly throwing themselves off a roof, they will now think twice
This condition is intended for Semi-Serious RP servers (MilRP, DarkRP, CWRP)

Bleeding
Bleeding is intended to spice up combat and make engagements more fast pace and intense
Bleeding will prevent players from hiding behind cover all engagement, and get in the there!
This condition is intended for combat heavy servers (MilRP, CWRP, some DarkRP)

Burn
Burns are intended to give fire some form of threat
Fire in most situations is seen as nothing, now players will think twice about rushing into the flames
This condition is intended for most all servers, and is just to make fire threatening

Disease / Rare Disease
Diseases are meant to break up the meta of AFK and farm money
In most DarkRP servers, you will find people camped out in their bases AFK with their printers
Diseases are meant to break this routine, and is meant mainly for DarkRP server
I would suggest disabling for MilRP and CWRP servers, but it still can be used and will work fine


I want to edit the change of getting a condition, how does it work?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a very simple process, a value of 4 will give a 1/4 chance of the condition being applied (25%)
Remember that conditions will be more common then they appear, don't be afraid to make conditions rare


I have an error, what should I do?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event of an error, please check the config.lua file to make sure you have not set a bad value
If you have a persisting error please get assistance by messaging me on my Discord or Gmodstore account
If you or your server developer has edited ANYTHING other than the config.lua you must let me know when I go to fix the issue
If you do edit the core files, you have essentially broken the warranty, I will still attempt to fix it but most likely will revert to the default version


I want to change my notification sounds
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please consult the sounds.txt file, it will give indebted information on how to enter custom sounds for the addon 


I have a suggestion for the addon, how should I contact you?
